# SOC meeting
// TODO(Tim): ISO dates. Remove irrelevant stuff
- Welcome
  - SOC Reps
    - Each club is assigned a SOC committee member as a point of contact.
  - Emails
    - We get an email: clubname-position@guild.uwa.edu.au
- Events
  - BBQs must be set up properly.
  - Student leadership training 19/4 - 20/4
- Did talk. Got the expected questions "How are you different from other computing clubs?", "Why are you just starting a club now?"

> Tim leaves to do secretary training
> Gozz forgets to take minutes
