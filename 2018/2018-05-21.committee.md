 - NP: Training session tomorrow?
   - What are we doing for that?
   - Gozz: I can't do it as I had planned to, too much stuff has come up
   - We can do interview training instead
     - As it's a good time of semester for this sort of thing
     - Given that there are only two weeks left of semester, and next week is project week
   - We maybe don't have quite enough people to run interviews
     - Max: It can also be difficult to run interviews well
   - Theo: So we're going for interview training?
     - Gozz: It seems like our best option
     - Max: Would we then not be doing anything for the week after next?
     - NP: So we'll do interview training tomorrow
   - Gozz: Who can prepare some problems and who can present?
     - Tuesday: Gozz, NP, and Nic O
     - Thursday: Gozz and Theo (maybe Max)
     - How are we presenting our problems?
       - No need for slides really
     - Solving on whiteboards in groups
     - Action: Max - Find some problems for interview training
 - NP: So are we doing training sessions next week?
   - Gozz: I suggest probably not, it seems like everyone (including members) is too busy
   - We're not locked into this decision though
 - NP: What are we doing over the break?
   - NP: I know that we have a contest in the works
     - Max: I'm worried that we won't have enough easy or hard problems
     - And hence the contest might not be enjoyable for many members
     - Gozz: Some easy problems can easily be whipped up
     - Action: Many - Whip up some easy problems at some point
   - Gozz: There is the UCC camp coming up
     - Which should have appeal to our members, as we'll be trying to run a contest during it
     - Action: Gozz - Advertise UCC Camp to our members
   - Max: There might be an ANZAC contest soon
     - Pending responses from Tim French
   - Max: I would like to see if we can cook up another contest to run during the break
     - Gozz: Should be doable then

   - They're vaguely interested, nothing concrete
